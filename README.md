This is part of the Odin Project - the first project is to create a basic webpage using skills learned on the foundations course. By completing this project I will have demonstrated my ability to use GitHub and Git as well as to use basic HTML to create a webpage. In the future I can expand upon this skills to further enhance the webpage with things like CSS and JavaScript. 

This project includes: 
- creation of this GitHub repo. 
- Using Git for version control and to commit to this repo. 
- Effective file management from the local machine. 
- Creation of boilerplate HTML for the webpage. 
- Creation of the index webpage and 
- Creation of headings and adding an image via HTML. 
- Ability to create relative links in the HTML. 
- Adding text content to the webpage via HTML. 
- Usage of both ordered and unordered HTML lists.
